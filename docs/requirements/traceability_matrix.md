## Overview

This **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** establishes bidirectional traceability between **Functional Requirements (FR)** and **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)** for the EcoWarriors Africa game. It ensures complete requirement coverage, facilitates impact analysis, and supports validation activities throughout the development lifecycle.

### Purpose
- **Ensure completeness**: Verify all requirements are addressed
- **Impact analysis**: Understand change implications
- **Test coverage**: Map requirements to test cases
- **Quality assurance**: Validate requirement implementation
- **Stakeholder communication**: Provide clear requirement status
